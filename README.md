# CSCI-561 Course Homeworks

There are three course homeworks, for CSCI-561.

First project involves developing an algorithm for path planning in a ski resort scenario. The task is to guide a skier through a 3D topographical map (Matrix) with varying elevations and obstacles like trees.
With considering factors like skier's stamina and slope steepness, we need find the safest and shortest path to a lodge for a celebratory cup of hot cocoa :), with the challenge varying based on the skier's skill level.

Second Project involves creating an AI agent to play Pente, a two-player abstract strategy board game similar to tic-tac-toe and Connect Four. A unique point is its piece capture mechanic.
On a 19x19 board, the objective is to either connect five pieces in a line or capture five pairs of the opponent's pieces. The capture mechanic only applies to pairs of opponent pieces. 
The game is known for its First Player Advantage (FPA), and the project will implement specific rules used in tournaments to balance this advantage.

Third Project involves designing an automated system for a new restaurant, aimed at managing dining room duties like seating customers, taking orders based on current stock and restaurant policies, and generating checks. 
Implement first-order logic resolution, where restaurant status, policies, ingredient stock, and customer status are encoded as first-order logic sentences. 
The system will handle logical operators like NOT, OR, AND, and IMPLIES to process queries and provide logical conclusions, allowing the restaurant to focus budget on quality chefs and ingredients.
