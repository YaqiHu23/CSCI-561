# CSCI-561 Course Homeworks

There are three course homeworks, for CSCI-561.

First project involves developing an algorithm for path planning in a ski resort scenario. The task is to guide a skier through a 3D topographical map (Matrix) with varying elevations and obstacles like trees.

Second Project involves creating an AI agent to play Pente, a two-player abstract strategy board game similar to tic-tac-toe and Connect Four.

Third Project involves designing an automated system for a new restaurant, aimed at managing dining room duties like seating customers, taking orders based on current stock and restaurant policies, and generating checks.
